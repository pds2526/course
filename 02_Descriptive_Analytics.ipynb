    "## Introducing Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "The *pandas* package is the most important tool at the disposal of Data Scientists and Analysts working in Python today. The powerful machine learning and glamorous visualization tools may get all the attention, but pandas is the backbone of most data projects. \n",
    "\n",
    ">\\[*pandas*\\] is derived from the term \"**pan**el **da**ta\", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals. — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_%28software%29)\n",

    "### Typical Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has so many uses that it might make sense to list the things it can't do instead of what it can do. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you want to explore a dataset stored in a CSV on your computer. Pandas will extract the data from that CSV into a DataFrame — a table, basically — then let you do things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculate statistics** and answer questions about the data, like\n",
    "    - What's the average, median, max, or min of each column? \n",
    "    - Does column A correlate with column B?\n",
    "    - What does the distribution of data in column C look like?\n",
    "- **Clean the data** by doing things like removing missing values and filtering rows or columns by some criteria\n",
    "- **Visualize** the data with help from Matplotlib. Plot bars, lines, histograms, bubbles, and more. \n",
    "- **Store** the cleaned, transformed data back into a CSV, other file or database\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you jump into predictive or prescriptive modeling you need to have a good understanding of the nature of your dataset and pandas is a great avenue through which to do that.\n"

    "Not only is the pandas library a central component of the data science toolkit but it is used in conjunction with other libraries in that collection. \n",

    "Pandas is built on top of the **NumPy** package, meaning a lot of the structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in **SciPy**, plotting functions from **Matplotlib**, and machine learning algorithms in **Scikit-learn**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks offer a good environment for using pandas to do data exploration and modeling, but pandas can also be used in text editors just as easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks give us the ability to execute code in a particular cell as opposed to running the entire file. This saves a lot of time when working with large datasets and complex transformations. Notebooks also provide an easy way to visualize pandas’ DataFrames and plots.\n",
